A webservice that returns HTTP status responses and information.

Example use:

/http-status/codes/200

Would return a 200 response with the additional json string in the resource
body.

{"code": 200, "name": "OK", "description": "The request sent by the client was
successful."}

/http-status/codes/500

Will return a 500 response, again with a json string describing the HTTP status
code.

/http-status/codes/list

Will return all the available HTTP status codes.

*******************************************************************************

After cloning the repository and ensuring that you have maven installed and 
available you can do the following.

-- Generate eclipse project files:
mvn eclipse:eclipse

-- Create a war of the service in the ./target directory:
mvn clean package

-- Start a jetty server on port 8080 with the service deployed to /http-status/
mvn clean jetty:run-war
